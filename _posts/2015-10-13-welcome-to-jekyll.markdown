UNHCR has drafted a report on the women fleeing the Central American Northern Triangle – El Savador, Guatemala and Honduras. There is a surging tide of violence sweeping across the Northern Triangle forcing thousands of women, men and children to leave their homes every day. 

The Women on the Run Report tells first-hand accounts of 160 women/refugees fleeing unimaginable gang violence and brutal domestic violence. Transgender women, in particular, experience a further exacerbated level of violence – discrimination, beatings and attacks from family members, partners, clients or employers, and others. 

The countries of the Northern Triangle have basic structural challenges to rule of law, citizen security, and justice. As a result, the women cannot rely on the police for protection and many have a lack of trust in government institutions due to police collusion. They flee north because they have no choice. It is a matter of life and death.
